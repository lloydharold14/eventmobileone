Use Koin for KMP (no Hilt in shared code). Hilt allowed only in :app-android if required, with a Koin bridge.

Each feature exposes a koinModule in its :feature:* module.

Dispatchers provided via DispatcherProvider interface in :core:ui with expect/actual if needed.

Singletons only in :core:* or platform modules; features must not create global singletons.
